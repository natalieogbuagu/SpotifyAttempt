# SpotifyAttempt
What I attempted to build: I attempted to build a program that would get your liked videos playlist from your YouTube account and create a Spotify music playlist from those videos.

What I learned: I learned that setting up a YouTube Oauth is extremely hard. 

What didn't work: I tried following this tutorial: https://github.com/TheComeUpCode/SpotifyGeneratePlaylist. However, setting everything up proved more difficult than what I anticipated, specifically, step 3. The directions say step 3 is "tricky," but I think that's an understatment. I spent multiple hours trying to figure it out because I genuinely thought this project was cool considering I love music, but I just couldn't figure it out.

Opinion: Setting everything up was really time consuming and I wish the directions were way more thorough, but this is a project I'd actually like to do in my free time. I'd need some help setting it up, but overall this seemed really cool and fun.
